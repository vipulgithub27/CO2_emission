# CO2_emission_Project
In this project, I have performed an analysis on CO2 emission in the world through various means like coal, oil and some others from year 2001 to 2021 using SQL
The idea is to calculate which countries produce highest and smallest amount of CO2 over ther period of 2 decades and which ones emitted the largest and smallest amount of CO2.
Furthermore, an in-depth analysis is performed such as the statistical description, the cumulative distribution and the percentile rank, the classification of the countries by three groups based on the emission of CO2. Also,the classification of CO2_emission per capita in India as  high,mid and low over the years from 2001 to 2021
The running total and the year over year percentage growth of  CO2 emission is also calculated.
